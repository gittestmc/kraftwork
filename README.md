## Exploratory Data Analysis Summary of findings

Findings 1:
In that Car feature has 99% of missing value. so we need to drop the feature because it has lesss predictive power
For other features like Bar,CoffeeHouse,Carryaway,RestaurentLessThan20,Restaurent20To50 has approx 1% missing values. we can fill these with some other value

Findings 2: It is observed total of 56.8 %  chose to accept the coupon

Findings 3: It is observed  maximum coupons accepted by users are Carry Out and Take Away. and least accepted is Bar coupons

Findings 4: On a another findings highest coupon counts are under sunny weather. users go out and accept more coupons in sunny weather
